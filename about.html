            <p>What is graphic design to me? It is about giving shapes an intention.
            <br>
            <br>
            I discovered this at a young age when I was playing my racing video games. Even though driving around a race track in my dream cars was fun, I was drawn more to the customization section. Graphics are an aspect of a car's appearance and to be able to build designs in those games they only provided basic rectangles and circles to create from.
            <br>
            <br>
            After spending countless hours letting my imagination run wild in those games, I fell in love with how the basic shapes could be tweaked and placed together to represent a meaning or create a feeling.</p>

            <h3>car culture</h3>
            <p>My passion for cars has always been a part of me ever since I was a little kid. I love how diverse these rolling metal sculptures can be and how it is influenced by the communities that surrounds it. I like to take my knowledge and references I have seen  throughout the years and introduce them into projects whenever I can.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Streetwear</h3>
            <p>It all started for me going to outlet malls and seeing the graphic t-shirts, hoodies, and sneakers on the racks. I found that it is a medium where interests in current culture or personal ethos can be expressed through what someone wears. The ability to fuse styles, tell a story, and merges unrelated things to create a new feelings or “vibes” is what I like taking away from looking at streetwear.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Electronic Hardware</h3>
            <p>Growing up my home was full of old electronics that my dad had laying around the house. Even though some are complete junk, it was cool to physically hold and see the devices in my hand to analyze how the functionality created the form. One thing that always drew my attention was the logotype or extra graphics on the hardware, adding the final unique touches to complete the device's appearance.</p>
